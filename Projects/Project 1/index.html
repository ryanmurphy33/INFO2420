<h1>Project 1 - Web Critiques - Ryan Murphy</h1>

Here is a link to their site: <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home" target="_blank">Trader Joe's</a>

My first impression of the site was very good. I thought that the site looked clean, crisp, and easy to navigate.
</li>
<li>
The site had some links to common products on the left side of the page. It also had a drop down menu for all other products at the top of the page. After clicking on links for different categories of products, there are more links to specific products and information about them.
</li>
<li>
The structure makes sense to me. It has links to the most common or popular items on the home page, so people can access them quickly. If you're looking for a more specific product, you can use the drop down menu and find a link to it there. It seems pretty easy to find whatever you're looking for.
</li>
<li>
I think the graphics used on this site are very on brand for the company. The layout is simple and the graphics add to the vibe or feel of the company site.
</li>
<li>
The home page loaded very quickly. I did not have to wait at all for it to load.
</li>
<li>
The text color and size was adequate in my opinion. I didn't notice anything that detracted from the site. I thought it was easy to read.
</li>
<li>
The site had a drop down menu, as I mentioned earlier, to assist you in finding which ever product you are looking for. They also had a search bar at the top of the page.
</li>
<li>
The site did have a color scheme that was consistent with the color scheme that Trader Joe's normally uses. It was consistent throughout the entire website. I thought the color scheme was very appealing.
</li>
<li>
The site seemed to respond well to smaller sized windows. The only thing I noticed was that the links to the most common products did not show up anymore and the drop down menu and search bar were the only other navigation tools available. 
</li>
<li>
Trader Joe's is a grocery store and they had a feature for a shopping list, which I thought was very neat. You could add whatever you needed to your list and find products for your list easily on the website.
